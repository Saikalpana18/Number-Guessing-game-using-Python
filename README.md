# Number-Guessing-game-using-Python
Overview

This Number Guessing Game is a Python-based interactive program where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a user-specified range. The game provides feedback for each incorrect guess, letting the user know if their guess is too low or too high. It also keeps track of the number of attempts made and provides a summary at the end.

Features

"Too low" if the guess is less than the number.

"Too high" if the guess is greater than the number.
